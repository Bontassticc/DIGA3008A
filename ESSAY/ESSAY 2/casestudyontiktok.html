      <h1>The Intersections of Internet, Geopolitics and Digital Coloniality: A case study of TikTok </h1>
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Bonolo Morojele</p>
   

    <section >
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Modern communication technology, with the Internet as one of its most integral components, 
        is widely regarded as essential for international social, economic, and political development. 
        However, while the Internet was once celebrated as a democratic space fostering free expression 
        and global connectivity, it has increasingly become a site of geopolitical contestation and digital 
        colonialism, particularly in the context of the power dynamics between the Global North and the Global South. 
        This shift is exemplified by the rise and regulation of global digital platforms such as TikTok, 
        which reflect the complex entanglement of technological infrastructure, cultural production, and political power. 
        As nations compete for control over data, narratives, and influence, TikTok's global presence illustrates 
        how the Internet is shaped by historical colonial legacies and contemporary geopolitical anxieties.</p>

      <p>This essay explores the interrelationship between the Internet, geopolitics, and digital coloniality. 
        Using TikTok as a case study, it examines how global digital platforms can simultaneously reproduce 
        and challenge existing power asymmetries.</p>
    </section>

    <section >
      <h2>Digital coloniality and the logic of platform capitalism</h2>
      <p>At the centre of current geopolitical concerns is the issue of digital coloniality, 
        which refers to the extension of colonial power structures into digital spaces. 
        This concept highlights how formerly colonized societies continue to be subjected to 
        control through technological infrastructures, data extraction, algorithmic governance, 
        and cultural dominance. In essence, digital coloniality represents a contemporary form of 
        domination, wherein powerful nations or corporations control and exploit the digital 
        infrastructures, data, technologies, and online behaviors of less powerful regions.</p>

      <p>Central to this dynamic is the rise of platform capitalism, 
        a system in which a small number of dominant companies extract value from user engagement, 
        data flows, and the circulation of content across borders. 
        This model not only reinforces economic asymmetries, but also facilitates the imposition of 
        dominant cultural content on less powerful parts of the world, 
        deepening the digital divide and perpetuating cultural hegemony. 
        Couldry and Mejas (2019 and 2023), they critically argue that datafication 
        mirrors colonial patterns, because digital infrastructures exact very much 
        like how historic colonizers seized land, labour, culture and knowledge, mainly 
        in the less powerful global regions. They frame the big modern technology corporations’ data 
        practices as a direct continuation of colonialism, hence they offer guides in terms of resisting 
        what they call “data grab”.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Involvement of TikTok in digital colonization and geopolitics</h2>

      <p>TikTok is at the centre of ongoing debates and contestations surrounding digital coloniality 
        and the logic of platform capitalism. Owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, 
        TikTok is considered one of the few platforms that have disrupted the Western dominance of social media, 
        historically led by companies such as Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and Alphabet (which owns YouTube).</p>

      <p>The platform’s rapid global expansion and cultural influence have sparked anxieties in the West over issues of surveillance, 
        data sovereignty, and ideological control. These concerns have led to bans or restrictions in countries like India, 
        the United States, and several nations in the Global South.
        TikTok’s “For You Page” delivers a user experience driven by viral content culture, often amplifying material that 
        aligns with dominant, frequently Western, and particularly U.S.-centric, standards of beauty, humour, and engagement. 
        Consequently, content creators from the Global South may feel pressured to conform to these norms to achieve visibility and reach.
        As Birhane (2020) notes in her critique of algorithmic colonization, platforms like TikTok do not merely host content, 
        they actively shape cultural participation by embedding dominant ideologies into their recommendation algorithms. 
        In this sense, TikTok can be seen as fostering a form of cultural homogenization, where local and multinational 
        expressions are either marginalized or reframed to fit globalized standards. Thus, the algorithmic biases inherent 
        in TikTok’s design illustrate how platform architecture can subtly reinforce existing power structures and limit the 
        diversity of cultural representation online.

      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond its cultural influence, TikTok has raised serious concerns related to data colonialism, 
        a process involving the extraction of vast amounts of user data without adequate transparency or user control. 
        This issue is particularly severe in regions with weak data governance frameworks. Users in Africa, Asia, 
        and Latin America contribute content and behavioural data that fuel the platform’s machine learning algorithms, 
        yet receive little to no value in return for their communities. Verdi (2020) and Shakir et al. (2020) refer to 
        this phenomenon as technocolonialism, where platform capitalism exploits digital labour and data from the Global 
        South under the pretence of providing connectivity and entertainment. These dynamics closely resemble historical 
        patterns of colonial resource extraction, only now, the resource is data, and the mines are mobile phones.
      </p>

      <p>
       From a geopolitical perspective, TikTok is not merely a cultural actor but also a geopolitical flashpoint. 
       As a Chinese-owned platform, TikTok has become central to the escalating tensions between China and the USA. 
       In recent months and over the past year, the USA government has expressed growing concerns about TikTok as a 
       national security threat, alleging that it could enable the Chinese government to access sensitive user data or 
       manipulate public discourse through content moderation. This situation reflects what Lutz (2019) describes as an 
       increasing awareness of digital inequalities at systemic and infrastructural levels, where control over digital 
       platforms translates into control over information flows and public perception. The accusations against China are 
       part of a broader technological rivalry in which digital platforms are perceived as extensions of state power.
      </p>

    <p>
       Although TikTok positions itself as a purely entertainment-focused platform, the political implications of 
       its global presence are considered undeniable by a number of countries, in particular the USA.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other countries, too, have taken decisive steps. India, for instance, banned TikTok in 2020, 
      citing data sovereignty and security concerns, but it also signaled an effort to reclaim control 
      over digital infrastructure. These actions echo what Graham (2014) describes as the uneven geographies 
      of the internet, where digital connectivity does not flatten global power relations but instead 
      reinforces them through infrastructural dependencies and policy asymmetries. Similarly, Greenstein, 
      Forman, and Goldfarb (2018) show how internet geography is shaped by national regulatory environments, 
      meaning the geopolitics of platforms like TikTok vary significantly across borders. 
      In the European Union and the U.S., efforts to regulate TikTok show how digital infrastructure 
      is increasingly seen as a domain of state control. These actions reflect a shift in global politics, 
      where the internet is no longer viewed as a neutral space but as a contested terrain of influence, 
      governance, and power. TikTok’s moderation policies also raise questions about whose values guide content 
      visibility: the platform has been accused of censoring content critical of the Chinese government, 
      such as posts about Hong Kong protests, Uyghur persecution, or the Tiananmen Square massacre, suggesting 
      that political sensitivities may shape its algorithm.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      TikTok is frequently viewed with suspicion, and it sits at the centre of ongoing debates 
      surrounding geopolitics and digital coloniality, raising questions about whether it 
      functions as both an agent and a target of digital colonization. In the West, TikTok 
      is often portrayed as a technological threat from China, an unfamiliar global power 
      seen as exporting its tools and values. In the Global South, however, TikTok can serve 
      as a Westernizing force in its own right, driven by algorithmic biases and dominant cultural 
      templates. This dynamic aligns with Magenya’s (2020) critique in her call for a feminist African 
      internet, where she warns that without critical intervention, platforms like TikTok risk reproducing 
      patriarchal and colonial infrastructures under the guise of progress and accessibility. 
      In this context, TikTok reflects both China’s expanding global influence and the persistent dominance 
      of U.S.-led platform capitalism. Its widespread reach highlights the complexity of digital power in a 
      multipolar world, where cultural expression, data flows, and regulatory frameworks are increasingly 
      entangled in shifting forms of soft power and resistance.

      <h2>Remedies for digital colonization and geopolitical challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Governments in the Global South should establish data protection laws that 
        are rooted in their unique socio-political and cultural contexts. Such locally 
        informed legislation can strengthen digital sovereignty, curb exploitative data 
        extraction by foreign platforms, and enable more equitable negotiations. 
        Drawing inspiration from the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
        these frameworks should assert digital rights in ways that reflect regional values. 
        As Graham (2014) notes, the geography of the internet is inherently uneven, and robust local 
        regulation is essential to address these imbalances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regional alliances, such as BRICS, the African Union, or ASEAN, should collaborate on digital 
        diplomacy strategies to offer alternatives to the dominant United States-China technological binary. 
        Multilateral cooperation can support policies promoting platform neutrality, infrastructure equity, 
        and digital nonalignment. Graham (2014) emphasizes that global internet governance must reflect a 
        plurality of interests, not merely those of technological superpowers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Platforms like TikTok must be transparent about how and when governments influence content moderation 
        or access user data. Public transparency reports, like those released by Facebook and Twitter, can help
        reveal the geopolitical pressures shaping digital spaces. As Lutz (2019) points out, such opacity drives
        distrust and deepens inequality in digital systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initiatives that improve digital literacy and content creation skills are critical for enabling users to 
        challenge dominant algorithmic norms. Empowering creators to promote authentic local content helps resist 
        aesthetic homogenization. As Robinson et al. (2015) argue, second-level digital inequalities are not just 
        about access, they concern unequal capacities for meaningful online participation. In this regard, NGOs, 
        universities, and cultural institutions have a vital role to play in fostering digital empowerment.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     
        <p>
          TikTok’s global ascent highlights the deep entanglement between digital platforms, 
          geopolitics, and digital coloniality. It simultaneously challenges Western technological 
          dominance and perpetuates algorithmic bias and cultural homogenization, illustrating how 
          power is exercised through digital infrastructures. Addressing these dynamics calls for 
          regionally grounded data governance, greater platform transparency, and robust investment 
          in digital literacy and local innovation. Ultimately, resisting digital colonialism requires 
          reimagining the digital landscape to reflect a plurality of voices, values, and forms of 
          agency—particularly those from the Global South.
