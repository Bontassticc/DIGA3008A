      <h2>Folder Structure</h2>

      <p>My folder structure reflects the hierarchical organization of the website content in a way that aligns 
        with we development best practices. I’ve created dedicated folders for each major component of the sites, 
        CSS files stored in a CSS/ folder, images and videos files in as IMAGES/ folder, and JavaScript 
        functionality in a JS/ folder. Meanwhile, each HTML page, such as index.html, portfolio.html and others, 
        sits at the roots level. This sort of structure separates concerns effectively; HTML represents 
        the content layer, CSS controls presentation and aesthetic, and JavaScript handles interaction logic. 
        This modular approach is both scalable and maintainable, and consistent naming conventions have helped 
        streamline navigation and development throughout the semester</p>

    </section>

    <section >
      <h2>Semantic Markup</h2>
      <p>In terms of semantic markup. I’ve made intentional use of meaningful HTML elements to convey the 
        structure of each page clearly. Elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <h1>-<h3>, and <footer> 
        help organize the layout in a way that’s accessible to both users and screen readers. Content sections, 
        such as animations and illustrations, are wrapped in <section> tags with descriptive headings that aid 
        in readability and accessibility. All interface components are appropriately tagged, images include 
        descriptive alt attributes and videos include playback controls, ensuring the site remains accessible 
        and understandable for users relying on assistive technologies. 
        This use of semantic HTML greatly enhances both usability and SEO.</p>

      <p>Interface elements are fully expressed, navigation is inside <nav>, and all media content is 
        tagged with alt for images and controls for video accessibility. 
        This improves usability and accessibility, making it easier for screen readers and 
        search engines to understand the page structure.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Metadata</h2>

      <p>Metadata has been carefully integrated into the <head> of each page. I’ve included a character set declaration, 
        a viewport tag to ensure responsiveness on different devices, and a description tag to improve visibility in search results. 
        To further improve machine readability and earn full marks on criteria, I also implemented and author meta tag 
        and incorporated microformats. For instance, I added an h-card with my name and profile link and used the h-entry 
        for blog posts where appropriate. These enhancements support semantic web principles and provide additional 
        context for search engines and other parsers, reinforcing the accessibility and discoverability of my content.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        On the styling font, my CSS has been structured across three separate and clearly defined files. 
        The base.css file handles global styles such as typography, layout.css is responsible for layout 
        structure like grids and spacing and component.css defines reusable components such as buttons and 
        cards. I’ve avoided inline styling, keeping the HTML clean and focused on structure. Responsive 
        design has been a key consideration throughout; I used flexible grids, relative units and media 
        queries to ensure the site adapts smoothly across screen sizes and devices. This helps provide a 
        consistent and inclusive user experience.
      </p>

      <section>
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     
        <p>
          JavaScript has been used to introduce interactivity and lightweight functionality. 
          I implemented DOM manipulation to create a local search feature that allows users to 
          find content feature that allows users to find content within the site without requiring 
          an internet connection or external APIs. Navigation highlighting, even handling for lightboxes, 
          and even keyboard interactions have all been managed through JavaScript. Scripts are linker 
          externally rather than embedded directly in HTML, maintaining a clean separation of concerns. 
          Where functionality is reused, such as navigation or gallery scripts, I’ve modularized the code 
          to keep it organized and efficient. While I’ve explored basic asynchronous behaviours, I’ve also 
          considered how further optimizations using async and deferred logic could improve performance in future iterations.

      <h2>Personal struggles and Wins</h2>
      <p>
        During the progression of my websites, I came past a lot of things that didn’t work for my website. 
        One of them being my API, whereby I tried to add it into my website, but the website link I was trying 
        to get the quotes from, was not working. I then had to manually include an API so from the website it 
        looks like it functions as an API but internally it was done manually. 
    
      </p>

      <p>
       Another thing was my footer links. For the life of me I could not figure out why the links where the colour it was. 
       Until I realised that it was because I didn’t even style my links, so they were a default colour.
      </p>

      
      <p>
       A win I had was having my hamburger menu be functional from the first time I tried it. 
       However, there were issues in loading pages, which was not due to my code because it was all right, 
       but due to my own personal device, as it worked on other people’s devices but not mine.
      </p>


      <p>
        I would say with every submission my website got better as my marks from the first website to the 
        present website have increased by over 20%, so I’m proud of the work and effort I put into my website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, my user interface and user experience decisions have deeply influenced how 
        the website functions and is coded. Clean layouts. Intuitive navigation, and semantic structure required 
        thoughtful implementations at every level, for HTML structure to JS interactivity. This project reflects a 
        careful balance between technical execution and creative design. It also demonstrates a commitment to accessibility, 
        performance, and user-centred thinking, echoing the principles and theories we explored throughout the semester.
