          <h1>Wireframes (Stay Tuned for Updates)</h1>
      
          <section>
            <h2>Homepage Wireframes</h2>
      
            <h3>First Idea of Homepage Wireframe</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/HomePageWF.jpg" alt="First homepage wireframe sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
              I'm thinking of a "floating" homepage, where my name and a greeting appear in the center, followed by a short intro
              message about my website. The “About” section will expand with a "Read More" button.
              For the background, I want to feature my own digital art or animated work.
              The top navigation dashboard will stay fixed across all pages.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Second Idea of Homepage Wireframe</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/HomePage 2.png" alt="Second homepage wireframe sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
              This version is similar to the first but emphasizes the “Hello World” intro by making it take up more screen space.
              The layout remains mostly the same, just scaled up visually.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Third Idea of Homepage Wireframe</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/Side Bar Homepage.png" alt="Sidebar homepage wireframe sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
              I explored using a sidebar for navigation that users can toggle in and out.
              This could give me more screen space for the content while keeping the interface tidy and interactive.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Updated Fourth Idea of Homepage Wireframe</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/Side to Side.png" alt="Side-to-side homepage wireframe sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
              I like the idea of sections popping out from the side and collapsing when not needed—similar to the sidebar idea.
              These expandable sections could also display more info before users click, doubling as navigation and previews.
            </p>
          </section>
      
          <section>
            <h2>Blog Wireframes</h2>
      
            <h3>First Idea of Blog Page</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/BLOG PAGE.jpg" alt="First blog page wireframe sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
              The top dashboard stays fixed, but the blog page layout introduces a title on the top left.
              Blog posts will show snippets with a “Read More” button that links to the full article.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Second Idea of Blog Page</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/Blog Sections.png" alt="Second blog page wireframe sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
              This version has a similar idea, but with changes in formatting and placement of elements for a different layout flow.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Updated Third Idea of Blog Page</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/Side-bar Blog.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Inspired by the sidebar homepage, this concept places blog post titles in a sidebar.
              Clicking a title reveals the post in the same view. Would this mean it’s a dynamic single page, not separate pages?
              It's something I’d like to experiment with.
            </p>

             <h2>Updated Wireframes <span class="badge-new">Updated</span></h2>


            <h3>HOMEPAGE</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/HOMEPAGE FRAME.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="300" height="200" />
            </div>
            <p>
              The homepage serves as the user’s first point of contact and is designed to be visually engaging while functionally clear. 
              At the top of the page, a fixed navigation bar allows easy access to other sections of the site. This bar remains visible across desktop and mobile, 
              transforming into a hamburger menu on smaller screens to preserve space and maintain usability. 
              The central feature of the homepage is a prominent hero section that includes a welcome message or tagline, 
              immediately establishing the tone and purpose of the site. Below this, a series of cards or buttons link to major areas such as the blog, 
              design section, and portfolio. These cards are styled with subtle shadows and clean typography to invite interaction. A brief "About Me" section follows,
               offering a snapshot of the site's author, and the page concludes with a footer that includes contact information and social links.
              Responsiveness is a key part of the design. On smaller devices, the layout adapts by stacking content vertically and resizing text and interactive elements for better readability. 
              The visual language of the homepage is clean and modern, employing a neutral color palette, ample white space, and a sans-serif font to create a calming and accessible experience. 
              Visual hierarchy is established through font sizing, spacing, and careful placement of elements to guide users through the intended journey.
            </p>

            <h3>BLOG PAGE</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/BLOGS FRAME.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="300" height="200" />
              <img src="../../IMAGES/MOBILE BLOG.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="300" height="200" />
            </div>
            <p>
              The blog page is designed to house a series of reflective posts documenting the site's development process and my engagement with course content. 
              Structurally, it features a grid or vertical list of blog cards, each containing a title, publication date, and a short excerpt. Users can click through to read the full post. On desktop, 
              a sidebar may appear to the left or right of the main content, offering quick links to each week's entry or filters by topic. On mobile devices, this functionality is replaced by a dropdown menu to maintain a clean and navigable interface.
              This page places emphasis on clarity and legibility. Cards are consistently styled and spaced to create visual rhythm, and each blog post follows a structured format with headings, body text, and optional images or embedded media. 
              To differentiate it from the rest of the site, a slightly more formal serif font may be used for the blog content, enhancing readability and giving the posts an academic feel. 
              The interface encourages engagement with each post while providing easy navigation across weeks.
            </p>

            <h3>DESIGN PAGE</h3>
            <div>
              <img src="../../IMAGES/DESIGN FRAME.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="300" height="200" />
              <img src="../../IMAGES/MOBILE DESIGN.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="300" height="200" />
            </div>
            <p>
              The design section serves as the most documentation-heavy part of the site, capturing my UX and UI decision-making process. This page begins with a short introduction explaining its purpose, 
              followed by clearly delineated sub-sections such as the interaction design (IxD) process, style guide, wireframes, and aesthetic reasoning. Each section is introduced with a strong heading and may be accessible 
              via internal anchor links that float or stick to the top for quick navigation.
              Visual content such as wireframes, sketches, and style samples are embedded throughout the page. These images are either accompanied by descriptive captions or presented in expandable lightboxes to allow users 
              to examine them in detail without interrupting the reading flow. Interactive components like accordions may be used to toggle sections, keeping the page clean while offering depth for those who wish to explore.
              The layout is responsive and adapts to smaller screens by collapsing side-by-side sections into a single-column view. Text sizes and padding adjust to retain readability. The aesthetic of this section aligns with
              the rest of the site but may use muted tones or background highlights to distinguish technical content from the more personal profile or blog pages.
            </p>

            <h3>ESSAY PAGE</h3>
        
            <p>
             The essay section is designed to present academic writing in a format that is comfortable and accessible for extended reading. It opens with a list of essay titles and brief summaries, 
             allowing users to select which essay to read. Upon selection, the user is taken to a dedicated view where the essay is displayed in full. The layout here prioritizes typographic clarity, 
             with large margins, balanced line spacing, and a consistent font size and style.
             A minimal interface is used so as not to distract from the content. If the essay includes references or citations, these are styled distinctly, possibly using block quotes or superscript links. 
             Navigation elements like “back to list” links or breadcrumb trails provide an easy way to return to the essay overview page. On mobile, essays retain structure and clarity through 
             increased spacing and text alignment suited to narrow screens. The choice of typefaces, color contrast, and whitespace are all optimized to enhance long-form readability, 
             lending the essays a professional and academic tone.
             </p>

             <h3>PROFILE PAGE</h3>
            
            <p>
            The profile page introduces me, personally and academically, aiming to be welcoming, informative, and stylistically consistent with the rest of the site. 
            At the top of the page, there is a portrait or stylized image of the student, followed by text sections that answer core identity questions: “Who am I?”, “What do I do?”, “Why this field?”, and so on. 
            These sections are written in a conversational yet concise tone, helping to establish a connection with the viewer.
            Additional sections may include a timeline or bullet list of achievements, educational history, or personal interests. 
            On larger screens, the layout may present the image and text side-by-side, while on mobile devices, these stack vertically for ease of reading. 
            The visual design uses familiar branding—colors, fonts, and icons—to ensure the page feels like an extension of the homepage. 
            Subtle aesthetic choices, like soft backgrounds or highlighted quote blocks, reinforce the profile’s tone without overwhelming its purpose
             </p>

               <h3>PORTFOLIO PAGE</h3>
            <div>
            <img src="../../IMAGES/PORTFOLIO.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            <img src="../../IMAGES/MOBILE PORTFOLIO.png" alt="Sidebar blog layout sketch" width="400" height="300" />
            </div>
            <p>
            The portfolio page is structured to showcase the student's work in an engaging and navigable layout. Projects are presented as visual thumbnails in a grid formation, 
            with each tile including a project title, a short description, and an optional tag indicating the medium (e.g., code, animation, writing). 
            Hovering over a tile reveals additional information or a link to a dedicated project page. Clicking on a tile either opens a modal window or navigates to a detailed view, 
            depending on the screen size and device.
            The layout dynamically adjusts for responsiveness. On mobile devices, the grid collapses into a single-column scrollable list, and interactions are touch-friendly with larger tap targets. 
            Filters are provided to allow users to sort projects by category or date, and these are implemented as dropdowns or toggle buttons. A clean and minimal aesthetic is used throughout, 
            ensuring that the visual content of the portfolio takes center stage. Animation effects like fade-ins or hover states are used sparingly to create a sense of polish and interactivity.
             </p>
