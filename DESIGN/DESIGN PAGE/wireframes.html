    <h1>WIREFRAMES (STAY TUNE FOR THE UPDATES)</h1>

    <h2>HOMEPAGE WIREFRAMES</h2>

    <h3>First Idea of Hompage Wireframe</h3>

    <div> <img src="../../IMAGES/HomePageWF.jpg" alt="HompageWireframe" width="400"height=300></div>
    
    <p> So, I’m thinking of having what I want to call a floating homepage. 
        My name and a greeting will be in the centre, along with a short and 
        sweet message about my website. Following that would be the “About” that 
        will show and talk more about me, and a read more button to open 
        that section. In the background I’ve thought of making my own drawing or animation 
        creations the wall drop of the website when you first 
        access it and 
        you are on the Homepage. At the top is the dashboard that does not move despite which page you are in. 
        The viewers then scroll down…
     </p>

     <h3> Second Idea of Hompage Wireframe</h3>

    <div><img src="../../IMAGES/HomePage 2.png" alt="HompageWireframe" width="400"height=300></div>

    <p>This second idea is similiar to the first one, however for this one i was trying to
        make it so that the "Hello World" intro took more of the screen space, 
        hence why everything looks so zoomed in. the setup is however still the same.
    </p>

     <h3>Third Idea of Homepage Wireframe</h3>
 
    <div><img src="../../IMAGES/Side Bar Homepage.png" alt="HompageWireframe" width="400"height=300></div>

    <p>So for this idea, i wanted to test out wether it would look nice and neat if the
        navigation bar, was a side bar that users could click and it pops out and clicl 
        and it goes back in, instead of it being a dashboard. 
        my thoughts are that it will provide more space for me to use the entirty of the screen,
        making the things i place around have morespace.
    </p>

     <h3>Updated Fourth Idea of Homepage Wireframe</h3>

    <div><img src="../../IMAGES/Side to Side.png" alt="HompageWireframe" width="400"height=300></div>

    <p> Ok, so for this one, I really think it would be such a unique look, 
        to hacve the sections pop up on the side like that. And also, like the side bar, 
        a click can push it back into the margin until you need it again. 
        im thinking that they can even show detail about what you are about to click,
        so they act as both a section and navigation bar.</p>


    <h2>BLOG WIREFRAMES</h2>

    <h3>First Idea of Blog Page</h3>
    <div><img src="../../IMAGES/BLOG PAGE.jpg" alt="HompageWireframe" width="400"height=300></div>

    <p>In the blog section of the page, the dashboard remains the same, however whatever page you are now on shifts to the title on the top left, 
        and the rest remain the same. The idea is that you will be able to see a snippet of the blogs and clicking read more, 
        opens the page with the blog in it.</p>

    <h3>Second Idea of Blog Page</h3>

    <div><img src="../../IMAGES/Blog Sections.png" alt="HompageWireframe" width="400"height=300></div>

    <p>I think this second idea is similiar to the first idea, however what is different is the formatting and the placements of the second one.</p>

    <h3>Updated Third idea of Blog Page</h3>

    <div><img src="../../IMAGES/Side-bar Blog.png" alt="HompageWireframe" width="400"height=300></div>

    <p>
        This idea came with the "Side Bar" Idea, of having the sections of the blog on the side, and once you click 
        on the blog you want to see, it appears on the side. Would that mean it wouldn't be a new page thou?
        I feel like that would be an interesting thing to try out.
    </p>
