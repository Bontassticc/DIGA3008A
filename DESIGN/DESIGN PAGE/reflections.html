                <p>
                    The kind of users I want to attract to my website are people interested in the work I do, such as animation (in the portfolio), developers and designers interested in scripts, and readers who want to engage with my blog content.
                    Ideally, my audience includes potential collaborators or employers looking for someone with my skill set. To meet their needs, the site should be easy to navigate, visually appealing (aiming for a cute but elegant aesthetic), and well-structured.

                <p>
                    Last week, I made solid progress. I designed a basic version of the site and created initial wireframes. 
                    These ideas are still evolving, but I feel confident about the direction and am proud of what I‚Äôve achieved so far.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Accessibility Considerations </h2>

                <p>When I mentioned that my website is optimized for accessibility, I was referring to three core aspects of inclusive design: <strong>readability</strong>, <strong>contrast</strong>, and <strong>mobile responsiveness</strong>. Below, I break down how each of these is being addressed through specific design decisions.</p>
          
                <h3>Readability</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Selected a Serif font ("Georgia, serif") for its clean, modern aesthetic and high legibility across screen sizes.</li>
                  <li>Body text size is set at <code>1rem</code> with a line height of <code>1.6</code>, promoting readability.</li>
                  <li>Used a consistent heading structure (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3) to support scanning and assistive technology navigation.</li>
                  <li>Avoided text justification to maintain even word spacing and support neurodiverse readers.</li>
                </ul>
          
                <h3>Color Contrast</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Main text (#2c3e50) on light background (#f7e7ce) has a contrast ratio exceeding 12:1, meeting WCAG standards.</li>
                  <li>Accent color (#d8a7b1) provides emphasis while remaining accessible.</li>
                  <li>Hover states include visual indicators beyond color, such as underlines or slight shifts, to support colorblind users.</li>
                </ul>
          
                <h3>Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Single-column layout adapts seamlessly to smaller screen sizes.</li>
                  <li>Images scale responsively using <code>max-width: 100%</code> and <code>height: auto</code>.</li>
                  <li>Spacing and padding are set in relative units (rem/em) for adaptability.</li>
                  <li>Navigation avoids hover-only functionality and features large tap targets suitable for touchscreens.</li>
                </ul>

                <details>
                    <summary>üîÑ What's New in This Section</summary>
                    <p>This section was updated to include specific practices for readability (font choice and spacing), color contrast (WCAG-compliant ratios), and mobile design (responsive scaling and tap targets).</p>
                  </details>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2> Interface Elements <span class="badge-new">Updated</span></h2>
                <h3> Buttons</h3>
                <p>
                    Buttons on the site are used to prompt user interaction, such as navigating between pages, opening blog posts, 
                    and submitting forms. These buttons are consistently styled with rounded edges, a defined color palette, 
                    and hover animations to give users visual feedback. They often appear as call-to-action (CTA) elements, 
                    with clear labels like ‚ÄúRead More,‚Äù ‚ÄúView Project,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBack to Top.‚Äù The hover state slightly changes 
                    the background color and cursor to indicate interactivity, supporting accessibility and enhancing user control. 
                    On mobile, button sizes increase slightly for easier tapping, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
                </p>

                <h3> Cards</h3>
                <p>
                    Card elements are used throughout the blog, portfolio, and homepage to group content into manageable, visually distinct sections. 
                    Each card includes a heading, an image or icon, a brief summary, and an action (like a link or button). 
                    Cards help organize information visually while maintaining a clean layout, enabling users to scan content quickly. 
                    Their use of shadows and spacing helps establish visual hierarchy and separation from surrounding elements. 
                    Cards scale responsively, stacking vertically on smaller screens to preserve readability and interactivity.
                </p>

                <h3> Navigation Bar</h3>
                <p>
                    The navigation bar is a persistent UI component located at the top of the site. 
                    It includes links to core sections‚ÄîHomepage, Blog, Design, Essay, Profile, and Portfolio. 
                    On large screens, it is displayed horizontally, while on mobile, it collapses into a hamburger menu to conserve space. 
                    This responsive behavior ensures ease of navigation regardless of device. The active link is visually differentiated 
                    (e.g., underlined or colored) to indicate the current page, helping users maintain orientation within the site. 
                    The navigation bar is fixed in place, allowing constant access to site-wide movement.
                </p>

                <h3> Media Containers (Images, videos, Lightbox)</h3>
                <p>
                    Images, wireframes, and potential videos are embedded inside stylized media containers that maintain alignment 
                    and proportion across devices. These containers may include borders, shadows, 
                    or padding to visually separate the media from surrounding text. Some images‚Äîparticularly in the design section‚Äîuse a lightbox 
                    effect that allows users to click and enlarge them without leaving the page. This enhances usability 
                    and allows for a deeper engagement with visual content, especially where annotations or small details are important.
                </p>

                <h3> Search Bar</h3>
                <p>
                    In the design of the website a search bar has been added in the homepage and in all heavy content based pages. This makes it easier 
                    speaially in heavy content based pages for users to find content they want based on a word search. 
                    How this works is that the users will search a word in the seaarch bar, if the word is in the content on that specific Page
                    the word will be higlighted.

            <section>
                 <h2>10. Before & After: Iterative Design Changes </h2>

                     <h3>Homepage Layout</h3>
                  <p> Before: The homepage used a large image header that pushed important content too far down. It lacked hierarchy, making the user's first impression unclear.</p>
                  <p> After: I reduced the image size, added a welcoming headline with a short intro, and included clear navigation buttons. This makes the purpose of the page more immediately visible and improves user flow.</p>

                      <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
                 <p> Before: The navbar was not responsive and would overlap content on smaller screens. It also lacked visual clarity.</p>
                  <p> After: I implemented a responsive navbar with CSS media queries and added spacing and hover styles to enhance clarity and usability on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>

                  <h3>Typography</h3>
                  <p> Before: I used multiple font types and sizes inconsistently, which made the site feel unstructured and harder to read.</p>
                  <p> After:I limited my typefaces to one header font and one body font, standardized font sizes, and used consistent line spacing. This created a more cohesive and professional visual style.</p>

                  <h3>Design Page Content</h3>
                  <p> Before: The design page had only basic descriptions of the process with no clear structure or reflection on the design journey.</p>
                  <p> After: I expanded the section to include a detailed project overview, goals, personas, accessibility notes, and UX decisions. This better demonstrates the thinking behind my design choices and shows awareness of theory and practice.</p>

                  <h3>Portfolio Display</h3>
                  <p> Before: Portfolio items were listed in plain text, which made them visually unappealing and hard to browse.</p>
                  <p> After: I used image cards with hover effects and titles, creating a more interactive and engaging presentation that invites users to click and view each work in more detail.</p>

                  <h3>File and Folder Organization</h3>
                  <p>Before: My file structure was unorganized, with scattered assets and unclear file names, which made site management difficult.</p>
                  <p>After: I organized the website into clean folders for CSS, images, and JS, and renamed files for consistency. This not only improved workflow but also reflected professional web development practice.</p>

                  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                  <p>Before: Alt text was missing from images and some pages lacked clear heading hierarchy.</p>
                  <p>After: I added descriptive alt text, semantic HTML elements like &lt;main&gt; and &lt;section&gt;, and made sure headings followed a logical structure (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3). This improved the accessibility and usability of the site.</p>
                  </section>

                  <section id="design-improvements" class="design-section">
                  <h2>New Additions and Improvements <span class="badge-new">New</span></h2>
                  <p>As the project progressed, I implemented several new features and enhancements aimed at improving both functionality and user experience across the website.</p>

    <p><span>Modular JavaScript Enhancements:</span> I refactored the JavaScript code to be more modular and maintainable. 
    This involved breaking large scripts into smaller, reusable functions and centralizing event 
    listeners to optimize performance and reduce redundancy. This approach also makes future updates 
    easier and helps keep the codebase organized.</p>

  <p><span>Interactive Lightbox Gallery:</span> To showcase portfolio images more effectively, I added an interactive lightbox modal. 
    This feature allows users to click on images to view larger versions in a modal window, navigate through images using arrow keys,
     and close the modal by clicking outside the image area or pressing the escape key, making the experience smooth and intuitive.</p>

  <p><span>Reading Progress Indicator:</span> On blog and essay pages, I implemented a scroll-based progress bar that visually tracks 
    how much of the content the user has read. This small UX improvement helps orient readers and encourages engagement by giving clear 
    feedback on reading progress.</p>

  <p><span>Removed the Password interactiom:</span> I had an slight issue with my password interaction code. It at somepoint just stopped
  as in the pop up code, when you click ok to porceed into the website, was not responding. That led to me not being able to access my website.
  I could not find out why it wasnt reacting so I just cancelled the code all together, becuase it would be more of a risk (if users arent 
  able to even access my website.) </p>

  <p><span>Local Search Bar:</span> I developed a JavaScript-powered search bar that functions completely offline and locally within the site. 
    It allows users to quickly filter and find blog posts based on their content without relying on external APIs or servers, ensuring fast 
    and private search functionality.</p>

  <p><span>Weather API:</span> I integrated a weather API to provide real-time, location-specific weather information directly on the site. 
    This addition enhances user engagement by delivering useful, dynamic content that changes based on the user's environment. 
    It also demonstrates my ability to work with external APIs, fetch live data, and seamlessly incorporate it into a responsive 
    and interactive web interface. Beyond functionality, it adds an element of personalization that can make the site feel more relevant 
    and connected to visitors‚Äô everyday lives. </p>

  <p><span>Removed Cursor</span> Due to the original mouse cursor not being accurate when users want to click on something. 
    I removed it and instead just addded a sprakle glow that tails the cursor, so that i can still maintain the uniqueness of my cursor
    to my website. </p>

  <p><span>Metadata and Microformats:</span> To improve SEO and comply with modern web standards, I added semantic metadata and microformats 
    throughout the site. Elements like <code>h-card</code>, <code>p-author</code>, and <code>dt-published</code> help search engines better 
    understand the content and provide richer search results.</p>

  <p><span>Visual and Functional Polish:</span> Lastly, I added small but meaningful features like a back-to-top button for easier navigation 
    on long pages, smooth CSS transitions for interactive elements, and consistent styling improvements to ensure a cohesive and polished look 
    across the entire website.</p>
