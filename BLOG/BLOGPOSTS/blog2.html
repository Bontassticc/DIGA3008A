    <h2>How does it speak to the internet today?</h2>

    <p> Stuart Moulthrop’s "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Law of Media" 
        explores the evolution of hypertext and its implications for media, 
        culture, and communication. The title references both the digital revolution and Marshall McLuhan’s laws of media, 
        which outline how new media extend, 
        obsolesce, retrieve, and reverse prior forms of communication. 
     </p>

     <p> Moulthrop’s essay is both a celebration and critique of hypertext’s revolutionary potential. 
        While he acknowledges its power to disrupt conventional media, 
        he also warns against overly utopian perspectives. His application of McLuhan’s
        media laws provides a useful theoretical framework, 
        showing that every technological advancement 
        carries unintended consequences 
     </p>

     <p> Moulthrop’s paper is a thought-provoking examination of hypertext’s cultural and technological impact. By using McLuhan’s framework, 
        he effectively situates hypertext within a broader historical and theoretical context.
        While hypertext has undeniably transformed media and communication, 
        Moulthrop’s analysis reminds us that revolutions are rarely as simple, or as liberating, as they first appear.

     <h2>Put in images of your first wireframe ideas and explain what you are thinking of doing.</h2>

     <p> So, I’m thinking of having what I want to call a floating homepage. 
        My name and a greeting will be in the centre, along with a short and 
        sweet message about my website. Following that would be the “About” that 
        will show and talk more about me, and a read more button to open 
        that section. In the background I’ve thought of making my own drawing or animation 
        creations the wall drop of the website when you first 
        access it and 
        you are on the Homepage. At the top is the dashboard that does not move despite which page you are in. 
        The viewers then scroll down…
     </p>

     <p> Once you scroll down you will now reach the explore page, where you will see all the section of my page. 
        You will then have to click one and it will take you to the page of the one you picked. 
        I liked this idea because I felt it would be a better interaction for the viewers to engage with. 
        To see the different sections of the page and be able to see which one they want to look at first. 
        Each one on display will show a bit of what is there, so for example for the blog section, 
        hovering over it will allow you to see a snippet of a blog written.
     </p>

     <p> In the blog section of the page, the dashboard remains the same, however whatever page you are now on shifts to the title on the top left, 
        and the rest remain the same. The idea is that you will be able to see a snippet of the blogs and clicking read more, 
        opens the page with the blog in it.
     </p>

     <p> For the portfolio section, we will have the title front and centre with a short and 
        sweet paragraph explaining my portfolio and what this page consists of. 
        Viewers will immediately see a snippet of the animation of drawings and whatever else I choose to add.
     </p>
