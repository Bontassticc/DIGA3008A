                        <li><strong>Easy to Navigate:</strong> I want users to easily find what they’re looking for and move through the site without confusion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Structured for Engagement:</strong> Visitors should be able to browse portfolio pieces, read blog posts, and access scripts seamlessly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimized for Accessibility:</strong> I’ll consider readability, color contrast, and mobile responsiveness throughout the design.</li>

                <section>
                    <h2>Style Process Documentation</h2>
                    <p>These are the different UI layout options I’m considering: side-navigation bar, top dashboard, floating dashboard, or section-based layout.</p>
                </section>
    
                <section>
                    <h2>Fonts – Readability and Legibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        The fonts I’m exploring are both elegant and fun, which aligns with the aesthetic I want. I’m slightly unsure if they lean too corporate and not playful enough for an artist's portfolio, though.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
                    <p>
                        I’m thinking of using clean, contrasting colors that feel sophisticated but not loud or bright. I want the site to look polished without overwhelming the viewer with color.
                    </p>
                </section>
    
                <section>
                    <h2>Interface Elements</h2>
                    <p>
                        I’m undecided on button style. Rounded buttons feel casual and friendly (which fits my vibe), while rectangular ones look more formal and business-like. Since this is an artist’s portfolio, I want a balance of casual and elegant—so I’m leaning toward rounded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I definitely want hover-over text that gives a preview or extra detail before clicking through, especially on the portfolio and blog pages.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Composition</h2>
                    <p>
                        I’ve come up with three new layout ideas for the Blog Post page and the Portfolio page—especially how they might look once you’re inside an individual project or post.
