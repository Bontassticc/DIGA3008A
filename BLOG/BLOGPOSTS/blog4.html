            read my blog posts, and have access to my portfolios ad scripts.
        </li>
        <li>Optimized for accessibility: when creating the website, i will consider readability,
            contrast, and mobile responsiveness.
        </li>
         
       
     </ul>

       </ul>  

       <h2>Style Porcess Documentation</h2>

       <p>These are the dfferent way i could implement my UI. I could make it a 
        side-navigation bar, a dashboard, a floating dashboard or sections?

       </p>

       <h2>Fonts - Readability and Legibility</h2>

       <p>These fonts fit the aesthetic that i would like for my website to have, 
        it's elegant but fun as well, which is something i really enjoy. 
        But i wonder if it gives to much co-operate vibes and less cutesy vibes?</p>

        <h2>Colour Palette</h2>

        <p>These are the colour ideas im thinking of using, 
            i really want something that looks clean and not like the colours are 
        screaming at you, so i dont want many bright colours, 
        just colours that contrast well with each other and give a sophiticated look </p>

        <h2>Interface Elements</h2>

        <p> When it comes to buttons, im not sure yet which kind of style of buttons
            i want to go for. Rounded buttons feel more casual and give and idea that 
            this is a somewhat casual website, but also has a touch of elegance to it.
            A rectangular button really screams serious business, and whilst i want 
            my website to be elegant, i dont mean serious, it's an arists portfolio after all.
        </p>

        <p>I do definitley want to have the hover over text that gives some 
            details before you clicl into the page. i feel that would work well
        for the portfolio and blog pages. </p>

        <h2>Composition</h2>
        
        <p>These are just 3 new ideas of how i could go about with my blogPost page, 
           portfolio page - what you would see once you are in the portfolio page</p>
