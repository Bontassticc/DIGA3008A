    <h1>WEEK 3:BLOG POST</h1>

   <section>
    <h2>User Alignment</h2> 
    <p>
        The kind of users that I want to attract to my website are people that are interested in the work that I do such as animation etc, 
        which they will see in my portfolio; potential developers and designers looking for scripts, where they will see my script page; 
        and readers that are interested in my blogs, reflection =s and the journey to creating this website. The goals that I want the viewer to have whilst being on my website, 
        is the need and want to explore what I do and what I have done and ultimately be contacted for work or a service, so preferably the type of viewers I would want are those that are looking for someone who can provide a service. 
        To align with the users my site will have to be easy to navigate, visually appealing (I’m trying to go for something cute but elegant) and clearly structured (no confusion about where to find things).

     <h2>Development progress of last week</h2>

     <p>During the week of last week, I feel I progressed really well, 
        i have created a basic look of my website and a wireframe of what i want it to look like in the future, 
        however the ideas are destined to change as the journey continues. 
        But for now i have a handle on it and I'm proud.</p>
