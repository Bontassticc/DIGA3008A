                    <h2>Close Reading of Ballatore, Graham, and Sen’s ‘Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results’</h2>
                     <p>
                        In their article Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine Results, Ballatore, Graham, and Sen (2017) 
                        take a close look at how search engines (particularly Google) shape the way we see and understand places. 
                        They focus on the idea of "localness" in search results and argue that what shows up online when we 
                        search for a place isn’t always local, and often reflects the dominance of certain regions, languages, 
                        and sources, especially from the Global North.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        To explore this, the authors ran a large number of Google searches for place names from locations 
                        all over the world. They used VPNs to simulate searches from different countries and analysed the 
                        top results based on where the content came from, what languages it was in, and how relevant 
                        it was to the location of the user. While Google claims to tailor results based on where a 
                        user is searching from, the study found that this "localisation" is inconsistent and often superficial. 
                        Instead, major sources like Wikipedia, large travel websites, and English-language news outlets dominate, 
                        

                     <p>
                        Ballatore et al. (2017) use the term digital hegemony to describe this phenomenon. 
                        Even though search engines appear to be neutral and helpful tools, they argue that the 
                        algorithms behind them end up reinforcing existing global power structures. 
                        In many cases, local voices and perspectives are either underrepresented or 
                        filtered through dominant Western platforms. This challenges the common assumption 
                        that the internet levels the playing field when it comes to access to information.
                        
                     </p>
                        
                     <p>
                        Their work ties in well with broader concerns in digital media and design justice. 
                        As scholars like Noble (2018) and Kasapis (2020) point out, access to the internet 
                        is not just about connectivity, it’s also about whether the content people find is
                        meaningful, inclusive, and relevant. If someone in the Global South is searching 
                        for information about their own town or region and the top results are written 
                        from an outsider’s perspective, that’s not truly empowering access. Instead, 
                        it reinforces a digital divide in terms of visibility and representation.
                     </p>
    
                    <p>
                        This also connects to discussions in digital geography. Greenstein, 
                        Lessem and White (2018) talk about the mutual relationship between geography and the internet, 
                        arguing that the digital doesn’t erase spatial inequalities but often mirrors or even deepens them. 
                        Ballatore et al. (2017) provide strong evidence of this, 
                        showing that digital infrastructures like Google’s search algorithm continue to privilege 
                        certain parts of the world over others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What makes this study particularly valuable is that it opens the door for future research. 
                        For example, would other search engines show similar biases? How do users from marginalised 
                        regions feel about the results they get? And how does language shape what content gets to be visible? 
                        These are important questions that could help guide more inclusive and equitable digital design going forward.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, this article offers an important reminder that just because something is online 
                        doesn’t mean it’s neutral or universally accessible. Ballatore, Graham, and Sen (2017) help 
                        us see how power operates in subtle ways through algorithms and platforms that we use every day. 
                        Their work challenges us to think more critically about who gets to be seen and heard in the 
                        digital world—and whose voices are left out.
                    </p>
