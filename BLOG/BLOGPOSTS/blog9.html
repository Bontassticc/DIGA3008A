                <section>
                    <h2>Nanjira Sambuli on Digital Equality (World Economic Forum, 2019)</h2>
                     <p>
                        In this interview, Nanjira Sambuli highlights how digital inequality is not simply about access to the internet, 
                        but about meaningful access, where users have the ability, autonomy, and resources to participate fully in the digital world. 
                        Sambuli's call for gendered and localized approaches is especially powerful. She critiques global tech development models that treat 
                        access as a binary metric, online or offline, without addressing structural inequalities that shape how different groups engage with technology.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        Her perspective reframes access not as an endpoint but as a continuum shaped by social, economic, and political forces. 
                        For example, even when women in parts of the Global South are online, they may face surveillance from family members, gender-based cyberviolence, 
                        or limitations on the type of content they can access. Sambuli’s view compels designers and policymakers to shift from metrics-driven digital 
                        development to people-centred frameworks rooted in justice, context, and empowerment.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        This aligns with broader critiques of techno colonialism, where Western-designed digital 
                        infrastructures are exported to the Global South without regard for cultural specificity or power dynamics. 
                        As noted by scholars like Ruha Benjamin and Sasha Costanza-Chock, tech systems often reflect the assumptions of their creators, 
                        frequently white, male, and Western, thereby reinforcing global inequities rather than dissolving them.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        This challenges South African digital transformation efforts, such as Takealot or public Wi-Fi projects, 
                        to rethink who is being served, how, and with what long-term effects. Digital inclusion must be intersectional 
                        attuned to the layers of oppression people face based on race, gender, geography, and class.

                    <h2>Kasapis (2020) – Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kasapis argues that internet access should be recognized as a basic human right because it is now integral 
                        to participating in modern society. Education, employment, civic participation, and even access to essential 
                        services increasingly require internet connectivity. His framing builds on legal-philosophical traditions 
                        that view rights as evolving with societal needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What makes this argument compelling is the way it pushes against neoliberal models of internet provision, 
                        where access is treated as a commodity rather than a public good. Kasapis warns of the dangers in leaving 
                        connectivity in the hands of profit-driven entities, which leads to unequal distribution, both within nations 
                        and globally. In rural South Africa, for instance, network coverage remains spotty, and data is expensive relative to income, 
                        locking millions out of the digital economy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Moreover, Kasapis connects the idea of access to freedom of expression, education, and democratic engagement. 
                      Without universal access, the digitally disenfranchised cannot meaningfully contribute to public discourse. 
                      This resonates with UN reports that consider internet shutdowns or denial of access as violations of 
                      international human rights standards.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the South African context, where apartheid’s spatial and economic legacies persist, 
                        denying or limiting internet access replicates and reinforces old patterns of exclusion. 
                        Recognizing the internet as a right would obligate the state to invest in digital infrastructure, 
                        local content creation, and digital literacy initiatives that are equitable and community driven.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                Both Sambuli and Kasapis push us to understand that digital design is not neutral.  
                It reflects and reproduces power. These readings align with Sasha Costanza-Chock’s 
                "Design Justice" framework, which advocates for community-led design processes 
                that centre those most affected by technological systems. From this lens, 
                the fight for digital equity is not just about wires and Wi-Fi, 
                it’s about redistributing power, amplifying marginalized voices, 
                and ensuring that digital futures are shaped by the people they affect.
                </p>
