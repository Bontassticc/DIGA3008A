                <h2>Week 1: Setting up Github and Publishing to Pages</h2>
                <p>The experience of setting up Github was one that was not very complicated, since we have used it before. However, adding
                    the new visual studio code and trying to link that to our Github proved a bit more challenging but only because we have
                    never used that before.</p>

                <h2>Reflection on the Readings</h2>
                <p>Reading *The Library of Babel* by Jorge Luis Borges alongside the timeline of the history of the web highlights an interesting connection between fiction and reality.
                    Borges' infinite library, filled with every possible book, echoes the modern internet, a vast, seemingly infinite collection of information where everything that can be written, 
                    in some form, already exists. However, just like in Borges’ story, finding meaningful or accurate information remains a challenge. The web is filled with both truth and misinformation, 
                    structured much like the chaotic and overwhelming nature of the Library of Babel.
                </p>
                <p>From a personal perspective, navigating the internet today often feels like being one of Borges' librarians, searching for valuable knowledge amid a sea of random, misleading, or repetitive content.
                    Search engines, algorithms, and AI tools act as the “indexes” that Borges’ librarians longed for—helping us make sense of the chaos. However, these systems are not perfect, and they raise 
                    concerns about bias, control, and the accessibility of true knowledge.

                <h2>Interesting Things You Have Found About the History of the Web</h2>
                <h3>The Internet Was Never "Planned" – It Evolved</h3>
                <p>The web's history is not a straight path but a series of independent developments that happened in parallel. Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web in 1989 was just one piece of a larger puzzle 
                    that included email, search engines, and social networks.</p>
    
                <h3>The Rise of Interactive & Social Web (Web 2.0)</h3>
                <p>The transition from static web pages to interactive, user-driven content (blogs, social media, YouTube, etc.) transformed how we consume and produce information. This is like how Borges’ characters theorize about a book 
                    that explains the entire library—social media has, for better or worse, become a space where people construct collective meaning.
                </p>
    
                <h3>The "Wayback Machine" is Like a Real-Life Library of Babel</h3>
                <p>The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, launched in 2001, preserves old versions of websites, much like Borges’ concept of an infinite repository of texts. It’s fascinating that we now have a way to look back at the history of web pages and see how information changes over time.</p>
    
                <p>Both *The Library of Babel* and the history of the web raise deep questions about access to knowledge, organization of information, and the human struggle to find meaning in overwhelming complexity. While Borges imagined an infinite library filled with meaningless combinations of letters, today's internet has developed tools that help us filter and extract meaning from its depths. However, just like in Borges’ story, the pursuit of ultimate knowledge remains just out of reach.</p>

                <h2>Goals for this Course</h2>
                <p>My goal for this course is to become more interested in the way the internet has been formed and developed, and to gain more insight into the theory behind the web.</p>
